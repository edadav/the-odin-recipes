    <p>This 45-minute cinnamon roll recipe is my go-to recipe when making cinnamon rolls because it produces the <strong>softest fluffiest </strong> cinnamon rolls ever. </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>300g self-raising flour</li>
            <li>2 tbsp caster sugar</li>
            <li>1 tsp ground cinnamon</li>
            <li>70g butter, melted, plus extra for greasing</li>
            <li>2 egg yolks</li>
            <li>130ml milk, plus extra for glazing</li>
        </ul>
    <h4>For the Filling</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1 tsp ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>55g light brown soft sugar</li>
        <li>2 tbsp caster sugar</li>
        <li>40g butter, melted</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            
            <li>Heat oven to 180C/fan 160C/gas 4. Grease a 20cm loose-bottomed cake tin and line the bottom with baking parchment. Mix the flour, caster sugar and cinnamon together with a pinch of salt in a bowl. Whisk the butter, egg yolks and milk together and combine with the dry ingredients to make a soft dough. Turn out onto a floured surface and roll out to a rectangle, about 30 x 25cm.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Mix the filling ingredients together. Spread evenly over the dough then roll it up lengthways, like a Swiss roll, to form a log. Using a sharp knife, cut the dough into 8 even-sized slices and pack into the prepared tin. Brush gently with extra milk and bake for 30-35 mins or until golden brown. Remove from the oven and cool for 5 mins before removing from the tin.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Sift the icing sugar into a large bowl and make a well in the centre. Place the cream cheese and butter in the centre, pour over 2 tbsp boiling water, and stir to mix. Add a little more water until you have a drizzly consistency. Stir in the vanilla essence, then drizzle the icing over the rolls. Serve warm or cold.</li>
        </ol>
